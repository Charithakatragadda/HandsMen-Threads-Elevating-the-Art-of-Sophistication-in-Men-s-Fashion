ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project repository is part of the Apex Specialist Superbadge Challenge, focusing on Provider Flow Integration within the Hive App on the Salesforce platform. The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate the ability to design, configure, and implement complex business logic using a combination of declarative tools and Apex programming.

The challenge simulates a real-world business use case where a Salesforce admin/developer is tasked with integrating a Provider Flow into the Hive App to automate provider record updates. The integration involves multiple layers â€” including placing the flow on the app homepage, adding it as a button to a Contact record page, and ensuring visibility in the utility bar.

This repository contains the entire project folder, including all Apex classes, flows, test classes, and visual documentation, following best practices in version control and Salesforce DX-compatible metadata structure.

By examining this repository, both new learners and experienced professionals can gain insight into how to approach multi-part Salesforce challenges involving UI customization, backend logic, and automated testing.
